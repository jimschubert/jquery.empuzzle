# jquery.empuzzle

Playing 'Jigsy' over at cityposh.com is pretty fun.  I received a few JavaScript errors in Google Chrome, so naturally I wanted to write my own puzzle plugin.

jquery.empuzzle is that plugin.

# N-puzzle

jquery.empuzzle is named for the N-puzzle it creates.  Since 'enpuzzle' isn't recognized as a _real_ word, it uses the archaic 'empuzzle'.  

# Usage

I'm going to try to keep the options as simple as possible.  Here is an example.

	$('#myOriginalImage').empuzzle({
   		size: 6,
   		target: $('#target'), 
   		blank: 'BR'
	});

# .empuzzle( options )

options available are:

*size* : `{Integer}`  
*win* : `function(game) { }`  
*target* : `{element}`  
*blank* : `{'TL'|'TR'|'BL'|'BR'}`  
*randomize* : `function(game, defaultRandomizer) { }`  
*anim* : `{jQuery animation options}`  
*DEBUG* : {true|false}  

An example of how to specify these options:

	var options = { 
        size: 6, 
        blank: 'TR', 
        win: myValidation /* function reference */ 
    };
